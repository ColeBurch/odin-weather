## This is a weather app that displays weather information for any city that you may search

This is a project written in vanilla Javascript utilizing webpack as the asset manager that was completed as part of The Odin Project Javascript curriculum. This project makes an api call to weatherapi.com and then sparses the data returned and displays it in a clean manner. A toggle for Celsius and Farenheit temperatures has also been included for those who are used to metric.

## Great UI Design!
